	1 --->int
	2 --->float
	3 --->char
	4 --->double
	

QUESTION 2:
   ANSWER:
	Any thing outside the function body is known as global statments.
	they can be. Any Function or any variable or any Non-primitive data type.
	These global function should be written on the top of the programe. 

QUESTION 3:
   ANSWER:

	float:
	   float uses single precision values.
	   It has 7 decimal digits of precision
	   It takes 32bit of space.
	   We use float for less precise and less acurate operations. 
	double:
	   double uses double precision values.
	   It has 11 decimal digits of precision.
	   It takes 64bit of space.
	   We use double to be more precsie and accurate operations.

	   They have spacial meaning.
	   They are limited only 32 keyword is used in C.
